# Automated Hydroponic System
---
## Project Overview
This project is an automated hydroponic system designed to monitor and control plant growth. It uses an embedded control system to read from sensors and actively correct for defficiencies to provide an ideal environment for the plants. The goal is to create an adaptive system that can be tailored to different plant species and growing conditions by dynamically adjusting nutrient levels, water flow, and other environmental parameters.

The system integrates:
- Microcontroller-based automation for pump control, nutrient dosing, and environmental monitoring.
- Sensor feedback loops (pH, EC, temperature, water level) to dynamically adjust conditions.
- Scalability & modularity, allowing for future expansion to support multiple plant types with different environmental needs.
- Potential IoT integration, enabling remote monitoring and adjustments via a web interface or mobile app.

This project builds upon a previous version (V0), which was a manually operated system with basic water circulation and 3D-printed structural components. Lessons learned from that prototype are being applied to V1, which introduces automation, real-time control, and improved system efficiency.
